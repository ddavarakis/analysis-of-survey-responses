#  Analyze bank customer satisfaction survey responses. 

The objective is to predict whether customers are satisfied with the bank based on their survey responses. 

The dataset consists of two different representations for the same set of customers:

1. Tabular data (bank-tabular.csv) which contains demographic information about each customer and ratings scores (1-5) relating to different aspects of their bank. A manually-labelled ‘satisfied’ variable indicates whether a customer is ‘satisfied’ or ‘dissatisfied’ with the bank.
2. Text data (bank-comments.csv) which contains short textual comments indicating customers' opinions regarding the bank.
